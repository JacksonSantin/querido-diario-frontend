      "As long as 150 years ago, official gazettes were already an essential part of Brazil, documenting the country's most significant decisions. Over the years, however, these official gazettes have remained the same, barely accessible, even with the arrival of new technologies.",
      "While the official gazette of the Union, states and municipalities - when capitals or metropolitan regions - receive more public attention, many smaller municipalities lack transparency and access to information. In these situations, the official gazette may be the only source of official information available.",
      "And even among the best cases of open data, another challenge exists: information about administrative activity is dispersed across a variety of websites and files on the internet. This makes it difficult to monitor the progress of public policies in the same municipality and even more impractical to compare decisions from different locations. Brazil has 5570 municipalities and there is no person capable of keeping track of so much widespread administrative activity.",
      "Querido Diário is tackling this situation by inaugurating a gigantic (and constantly expanding!) integrated data source on municipal official gazettes. A monumental undertaking given not only the large number of municipalities and government websites, but also the variety of official gazette formats, since there are no regulations to standardize them."

    "title": "History",
    "texts": [
      "The Querido Diário project is the result of two similar initiatives that were born at different times.",
      "The first idea was conceived by Open Knowledge Brazil and was called <a href='https://github.com/okfn-brasil/queriDO' target='_blank'>\"Projeto Nosso Querido Diário Oficial\", queriDO in short</a>. The initiative established a methodology for retrieving information registered in the official gazettes, based on the interests and goals of the community, which would be formed by two groups: the curators, who would define the \"targets\", establishing which subjects and official gazettes they wish to focus on; and the experts - people who are passionate about open data and who would code the data scrapers.",
      "The second idea was inspired by the success of <a href='https://serenata.ai/en/' target='_blank'>Serenata de Amor Operation</a>, which, through <a href='https://twitter.com/RosieDaSerenata' target='_blank'>Rosie</a>, a robot that exposes suspicions of misuse of public money by federal deputies, led countless people in Brazil to ask for the same tool for their states and municipalities. As the operation focused on the National Congress, the algorithms were limited to the scope of the federal sphere. Then came the “local official gazette” side of the Serenata project, with the objective of expanding the analyzes to the municipal sphere.",
      "In 2018, when the Serenata de Amor Operation was already within Open Knowledge Brazil, it was defined that the code base of those two projects would be one and named “Querido Diário”. Initially, the initiative would collect municipalities' official gazettes files and create mechanisms to analyze waiver of bidding, but this idea faced many technical challenges and did not have a strong engagement.",
      "The following year, we decided to reactivate the community to focus on writing as many scrapers as possible and increasing our coverage of municipalities in Brazil. The result was fantastic, as in less than two years we went from covering less than 100 municipalities to reaching coverage of more than 2,200 municipalities.",
      "In the second half of 2020, we got our first funding, through a call from Empatía project promoted by <a href='https://idatosabiertos.org/en/' target='_blank'>ILDA</a>. The resource was sponsored by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). This support allowed us to start the development of our open API and also our search platform.",
      "Querido Diário's website was launched on July 20, 2021. It is possible for anyone to search for content using keywords, municipalities or dates."
